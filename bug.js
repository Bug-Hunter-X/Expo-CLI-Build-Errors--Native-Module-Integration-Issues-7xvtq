This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a dependency on a native module that is not properly configured for Android or iOS.  The most common symptoms include build failures, linking errors, and general errors related to native module integration.  For example, you might see errors related to missing headers, undefined symbols, or incorrect linking configurations.  The code below shows a simplified example where an attempt is made to use a native module that isn't correctly linked. 
```javascript
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

MyNativeModule.someNativeFunction();
```
