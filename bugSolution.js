A proper solution depends on the specific native module in question.  However, the general approach involves correctly configuring the module for both Android and iOS within the Expo project.  Here's a conceptual outline:

1. **Follow the Module's Documentation:**  Consult the native module's documentation carefully for Expo-specific instructions.  Many native modules provide detailed guidance on integrating with Expo's build system.
2. **Expo Go Limitations:** Remember that some native modules may not be fully compatible with Expo Go.  You might need to use Expo's EAS Build to create a standalone APK or IPA.
3. **Autolinking (Expo Managed):**  Expo often automates native module linking in managed workflows. If autolinking is failing for any reason, it may involve manual configurations.  
4. **Manual Linking (Bare workflows/Advanced):** For bare workflows,  You might need to manually link the native module using the appropriate commands for Android and iOS (this often involves modifying native project files).
5. **Postinstall scripts:** Ensure that any required post-install scripts from the native module are correctly executed (often in a `postinstall` script in your `package.json`)

This example only shows a high level of implementation; proper implementation will require specific steps based on the native module that is being integrated.
```javascript
// This is a placeholder. A real solution would require proper native module integration, which is not possible to represent fully in a simple code example.
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

// Assume this module is now correctly linked
const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

MyNativeModule.someNativeFunction(); // Now this should function correctly
```
